# Notepad_Clone
My project is a Notepad clone created using Java Swing and Java AWT. It is a text editor application that mimics the features of the popular Notepad program. It allows users to create, open, edit, and save text files. The Java Swing and Java AWT libraries are used to create the graphical user interface (GUI) components such as buttons, menus, and text areas. 

-------------------------------------------
Features-
Notepad clone project using Java Swing and Java AWT can have several features. Here are some common features you can consider implementing:

1. Text Editing: Allow users to create, open, edit, and save text files.
2. Formatting: Provide options for font selection, text size, bold, italic, and underline.
3. Cut/Copy/Paste: Allow users to cut, copy, and paste text within the editor.

Technologies used -
The technologies used in your Notepad clone project include Java Swing and Java AWT. Java Swing is a set of GUI (Graphical User Interface) components and tools for building desktop applications in Java. It provides a rich set of features and allows you to create interactive and visually appealing user interfaces. Java AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) is an older GUI toolkit for Java that provides a foundation for building GUI applications. It includes classes for creating windows, buttons, menus, and other GUI components. By combining the power of Java Swing and Java AWT, you can create a robust and user-friendly Notepad clone application.
